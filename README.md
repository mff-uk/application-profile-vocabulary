# Data Specification Vocabulary (DSV) and its Default Application Profile (DSV-DAP)

This vocabulary defines vocabulary (classes and properties) and a default application profile for machine processable representation of Data Specifications and Application Profiles.
DSV and DSV-DAP is currently being implemented in the [Dataspecer](https://dataspecer.com) tool for management of data specifications, management of application profiles and semi-automatic generation of technical artifacts such as data schemas and transformations based on semantic vocabularies.

Since the visual editor is currently under development and the resulting images are not yet properly presentable, here we have a manually created graphical UML Class Diagrams-like representation:

As a proof-of-concept, dogfooding and for state-of-implementation demonstration purposes, below you can find generated representations of DSV and DSV-AP from a current version of Dataspecer, DSV-AP represented using DSV-AP:
- [DSV Vocabulary Specification from Dataspecer](dsv)
- [DSV Vocabulary in RDF Turtle](dsv.ttl)
- [DSV Default Application Profile from Dataspecer](dsv-dap)
